#### Homework 4
## Projects
#### Project 1
Generating several datasets with points that are linear, quadratic, and nonlinear. Than perform a linear regression model and two different smoothing cubic spline models, then compare their results as to how they align with the true information. We check how linearity, MSE, Bias, Variance, and noise affect the accuracy of our above models. Then we conclude on how ideal the functionality of the above methods are.
